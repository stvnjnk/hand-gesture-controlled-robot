# hand-gesture-controlled-robot
Developed a hand gesture-controlled robot using Arduino, RF communication, and the MPU6050 sensor. The project uses 433MHz RF modules to wirelessly control a robot car through gestures, eliminating physical controllers and creating a seamless, user-friendly interface for robotics control.
